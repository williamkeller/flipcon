- question: Where is the payment page on this site?
  answer: >
    There isn't one. Send your donation directly to the campaign sites; no money
    is handled through this site.

- question: Do we send our donation money to the GM?
  answer: >
    No! Send it directly to the campaign sites, not to the GM.

- question: What happens if the game I want is filled up?
  answer: >
    That is definitely unfortunate. Contact the GM; if there is enough demand, perhaps they will run
    an additional session.

- question: What game systems are allowed?
  answer: >
    Anything at all. Whatever game makes you happy and will draw players is fine by us.

- question: Are any other candidates or groups allowed for donation?
  answer: Not at this time.

- question: I'm a Republican and want the Republican candidates to win.
  answer: >
    That wasn't a question. You're certainly free to support whomever you want, but this might
    not be the event for you.

- question: Who is responsible for this?
  answer: >
    Jim Walls had the initial idea, based on the success of the previously run Lawful Good Gaming.
    Will Keller never has any good ideas, but can get overly excited about the ideas of others.
