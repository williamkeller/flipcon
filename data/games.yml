    The Lady in Blue, a mysterious figure of cosmic power, enlists a band of simple peasants for a strange
    task. They are to follow an invisible bridge until they arrive at a hole in the sky – and then jump 
    through. Death awaits all but the bravest, strongest, and luckiest, but the Lady offers a reward beyond
    all the riches of the world - the chance to change the very stars these peasants were born under, and 
    thus change their destiny.

    The stories we tell are often not of gallant survivors but of the hard-pressed, star-crossed crestfallen.
    They are the poetry of the broken and their inhuman breakers: haunting things, deep, dark, bellowing 
    things, unfathomable things that consume any and all who approach the edge of their precipice.
    <br/><br/>
    "Sunken, An RPG of Nautical Horror" is a tabletop roleplaying game about these things, and the sea, 
    and how your characters find their doom among these things while at sea. There might be survivors, but
    that does not necessarily mean a happy ending. It draws its inspiration from sources diverse, like 
    Coleridge's epic poem "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner," the movie "Alien", and the PC game 
    "Return of the Obra Dinn." 
    <br/><br/>
    Rules will be taught at the table; the "Trophy" d6 system is very easy to grasp. Characters will 
    also be generated at the beginning of the session. Players will then be prompted to choose one of three
    scenarios:
    <br/><br/>
    * Your ship comes upon the still-afloat ghostly hulk of the East Passage Company’s infamous flagship, 
    and the allure of whatever great salvage might be found aboard...
    <br/><br/>
    * Winter closes its clutches early on the southern passage, stranding your ship in pack ice, until 
    another vessel of mysterious nature arrives, seemingly with the intent to rescue you... 
    <br/><br/>
    * Following a tip about the whereabouts of the missing Founder of the East Passage Company, a small crew
    of seafarers venture into what they believe is an undersea utopia...

    The Inn at Five Points is a local landmark, known for decent food, good drink, a good night's rest - and a
    special reputation for neutrality. Warring parties use the Inn to negotaiate and make peace. And now the
    amenable neutrality of the Inn has attracted the attention of the Crawling Lord, the most extreme and
    defender of Law. Can a rag-tag group of adventurers prevent the ascension of the vile Crawling Lord? Will
    they ever see the light of day again? And what exacty makes Arlo and Quendy's rosemary bread so addictive?
    All this and more shall be answered a the Inn at Five Points.

    In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream
    <br/><br/>
    In this introductory cinematic adventure of the Alien RPG, your mining ship is diverted to answer a 
    distress beacon. Common practice for the company, but what you find in the lost, derelict craft is 
    anything but common.
    <br/><br/>
    This scenario provides pre-generated characters with differing agendas which may lead to PVP at the game 
    table. Consider it as you would a game such as the board games of Battlestar Galactica, Shadows over 
    Camelot, or Dead of Winter - you all succeed when working together but each character has different (and
    potentially opposing) victory conditions.
    <br/><br/>
    Adult themes - as in movies of the Alien franchise, you can expect horror, panic, gore, body horror, and
    other adult themes. Not all characters are expected to survive, and the ending may not be a happy one.
