    The Lady in Blue, a mysterious figure of cosmic power, enlists a band of simple peasants for a strange
    task. They are to follow an invisible bridge until they arrive at a hole in the sky – and then jump 
    through. Death awaits all but the bravest, strongest, and luckiest, but the Lady offers a reward beyond
    all the riches of the world - the chance to change the very stars these peasants were born under, and 
    thus change their destiny.

    special reputation for neutrality. Warring parties use the Inn to negotaiate and make peace. And now the
    amenable neutrality of the Inn has attracted the attention of the Crawling Lord, the most extreme and
    defender of Law. Can a rag-tag group of adventurers prevent the ascension of the vile Crawling Lord? Will
    they ever see the light of day again? And what exacty makes Arlo and Quendy's rosemary bread so addictive?
    All this and more shall be answered a the Inn at Five Points.

    In Space, No One Can Hear You Scream
    <br/><br/>
    In this introductory cinematic adventure of the Alien RPG, your mining ship is diverted to answer a 
    distress beacon. Common practice for the company, but what you find in the lost, derelict craft is 
    anything but common.
    <br/><br/>
    This scenario provides pre-generated characters with differing agendas which may lead to PVP at the game 
    table. Consider it as you would a game such as the board games of Battlestar Galactica, Shadows over 
    Camelot, or Dead of Winter - you all succeed when working together but each character has different (and
    potentially opposing) victory conditions.
    <br/><br/>
    Adult themes - as in movies of the Alien franchise, you can expect horror, panic, gore, body horror, and
    other adult themes. Not all characters are expected to survive, and the ending may not be a happy one.
