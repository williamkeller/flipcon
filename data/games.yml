    The Lady in Blue, a mysterious figure of cosmic power, enlists a band of simple peasants for a strange
    task. They are to follow an invisible bridge until they arrive at a hole in the sky – and then jump 
    through. Death awaits all but the bravest, strongest, and luckiest, but the Lady offers a reward beyond
    all the riches of the world - the chance to change the very stars these peasants were born under, and 
    thus change their destiny.

    The Inn at Five Points is a local landmark, known for decent food, good drink, a good night's rest - and a
    special reputation for neutrality. Warring parties use the Inn to negotaiate and make peace. And now the
    amenable neutrality of the Inn has attracted the attention of the Crawling Lord, the most extreme and
    defender of Law. Can a rag-tag group of adventurers prevent the ascension of the vile Crawling Lord? Will
    they ever see the light of day again? And what exacty makes Arlo and Quendy's rosemary bread so addictive?
    All this and more shall be answered a the Inn at Five Points.
