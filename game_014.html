    <th colspan='2'>The stories we tell are often not of gallant survivors but of the hard-pressed, star-crossed crestfallen. They are the poetry of the broken and their inhuman breakers: haunting things, deep, dark, bellowing  things, unfathomable things that consume any and all who approach the edge of their precipice. <br/><br/> "Sunken, An RPG of Nautical Horror" is a tabletop roleplaying game about these things, and the sea,  and how your characters find their doom among these things while at sea. There might be survivors, but that does not necessarily mean a happy ending. It draws its inspiration from sources diverse, like  Coleridge's epic poem "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner," the movie "Alien", and the PC game  "Return of the Obra Dinn."  <br/><br/> Rules will be taught at the table; the "Trophy" d6 system is very easy to grasp. Characters will  also be generated at the beginning of the session. Players will then be prompted to choose one of three scenarios: <br/><br/> * Your ship comes upon the still-afloat ghostly hulk of the East Passage Companyâ€™s infamous flagship,  and the allure of whatever great salvage might be found aboard... <br/><br/> * Winter closes its clutches early on the southern passage, stranding your ship in pack ice, until  another vessel of mysterious nature arrives, seemingly with the intent to rescue you...  <br/><br/> * Following a tip about the whereabouts of the missing Founder of the East Passage Company, a small crew of seafarers venture into what they believe is an undersea utopia...
